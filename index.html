    <p class="post-inner">We have permenatly reenabled dark mode + saving on all author pages, fixed all the bugs and yeah. Hope this saves all of your eyes cause it saved mines. </p><h3 class="post-subtitle">How did we reenable it?</h3><hr><p class="post-inner">There was mainly 3 bugs when we figured out that there was a problem with the authors page dark mode/theme. 1. We forgot to add a id to the body tag, you get the idea... we forgot to add stuff we added to the home page, making us not able to find out what it was because we made this blog on replit, and that replit does not show the errors on the console. We fixed it today because me (grandswager), used the Google Chrome Inspect Tools and figured out why/how it didn't work. Summary: Replit should add a feature so that developers can see all pages' errors in the console within HTML, CSS, and JS. Overall this was a disaster, Grandcoyote2 suggesting to remove this feature, panic, and most importantly, our eyes burning.</p>

    <p class="post-inner">We temporarily disabled the dark mode because it had a lot of bugs and we needed to clean it up. Don't worry, it will be back soon and you're eyes won't die from the insane brightness.</p>

    <p class="post-inner">This blog is completely random. Made by @Grandcoyote2, @grandswager and @perutzism. This blog is made with only HTML, CSS and Javascript. It isn't powered by any blogging platform. We will mostly probably be talking about coding stuff, gaming and brand new updates. Most of the coding is done by <a href="/author:grandswager" class="post-content-link">grandswager</a> (I don't know that much of coding). You will sometimes notice that images don't load that is because they are taken from a custom made cdn (content delivery network) and sometimes the cdn crashes, so its not your internet's problem.</p>
